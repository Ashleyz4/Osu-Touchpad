# Osu-Touchpad
A touchpad made specifically for Osu!

# How to use
Download the repo, extract it to a folder and use `npm install` to install the node modules. Then you can use `node OsuTouchpad.ts` to start the server. Connect to the IP shown on your phone or another computer (on the same network) and there you go!

# Why did I make this?
There are many other touchpad programs for osu but they're all kinda odd.
